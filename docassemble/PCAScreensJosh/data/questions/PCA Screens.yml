question: Question
subquestion: |
  Is this your first, second, third, or subsequent offence?
fields:
  - no label: LSC_PCA_number_of_offences_question
    datatype: radio
    choices: 
      - First Offence: first_offence
      - Second Offence: second_offence
      - Third Offence: third_offence 
      - Subsequent Offence: subsequent_offence

  # I'm not sure how to implement this but I think it would be easiest to have whatever option they select link up with a BAC question connected to it. E.g. they select 'third_offence' and it takes them to the 'LSC_BAC_range_question_third offence' question. From there they select, for instance, <0.08 BAC. That would trigger the 'cat1_thirdoffence' notice screen. From there we can ask if a child was present (it doesn't affect the fine, only the way they go about getting their license back).
  
  #Chat to me about it if this makes no sense.

  Was a child under the age of 16 present?

  # This question should come after the (number of prior offences) and (PCA level) questions since it's always the same but I'm not sure how to implement this? I've left it seperate because it's probably something we can do fairly easily. If not, we can fix it before S2.
